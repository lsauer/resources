Evolution - A big lie? (brackets contain /transliteration and aux.information;) translation is intentionally close to the literal german narration; era: Bush-administration; author: lo sauer '04)

2
00:00:27,682 --> 00:00:31,637
Good evening ladies and gentlemen. What we all saw yesterday,...

3
00:00:31,949 --> 00:00:36,432
...shows once again how effective natural sciences are, at least when it comes to calculating planetary trajectories.

4
00:00:36,872 --> 00:00:47,816
In the night sky, relatively easy to spot,
 are the inner planets, Mercury and Venus, 
- their orbit around the sun is slightly tilted-,..

5
00:00:48,113 --> 00:00:58,841
..and yesterday a relatively rare constellation happened, with Venus moving across the corona of the sun -

6
00:00:59,212 --> 00:01:06,176
an event, relatively well observable from earth. The whole scenario only took about six hours, yet here for us everything moves much faster, almost "in fast forward", taking just a few seconds. 

7
00:01:06,481 --> 00:01:14,306
The calculations were extremely accurate, another triumph for the natural-science-based model of the world.  

8
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:18,248
But in science not everything is so unambiguous and clear cut.

9
00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:25,131
For generations researchers have tried to solve 

00:01:18,248 --> 00:01:25,131
the question of how life came into existence.

10
00:01:25,131 --> 00:01:30,368
Moasic pieces were therefore collected - the result was the theory of evolution.

11
00:01:30,368 --> 00:01:37,701
Yet there are a group of people, especially in the USA, who'd like it all simpler and more homespun.

12
00:01:37,701 --> 00:01:51,610
They don't believe in a complex developmental history for life, but rather they claim that there was an Intelligent Creator, who constructed everything at the shortest time - in the way we observe it nowadays.

13
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:58,361
Museums and theme parks are financed by them, to bring this idea to the public.

14
00:01:58,624 --> 00:02:08,514
Here in San Diego, California, is such a center, and in the showcases history of development proceeds at frantic pace.

15
00:02:08,514 --> 00:02:11,710
In a few days everything was finished.

16
00:02:11,996 --> 00:02:20,317
Or here in this adventure park, demonstrated are how all animals and man, was somehow created in six days out of nothingness.

17
00:02:20,625 --> 00:02:26,415
A fantastic and apparently catchy story about our origins.

18
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:36,547
Other than these creationists, the official Church copes well now with the findings of modern natural sciences.

19
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:44,721
It doesn't persist that the literal sense of the bible also equates to the physical state of the world.

20
00:02:44,721 --> 00:02:53,989
The creationists instead try to establish, within a diffuse religious background, their simple view of the world...

21
00:02:54,747 --> 00:03:09,589
...- and one could pass by it, if it weren't for the concurrent trend of the present American (Bush) government of adopting this (religious) for its educational policy.

22
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:12,111
Is this the way back into medieval times?

23
00:03:12,111 --> 00:03:19,176
Firstly a glance at how natural scientists understand the formation of life.

24
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:30,040
Feeding and being fed upon. This battle shows the constant struggle of the chance to survive.

25
00:03:32,104 --> 00:03:37,722
All possibilities are being exhausted, in order to find a niche allowing for ones own existence.

26
00:03:38,743 --> 00:03:43,439
Successful at this, is the organism best adapted to its environment.

27
00:03:43,692 --> 00:03:50,258
But with this (adapation) alone its survival isn't guaranteed forever, because the environment changes constantly.

28
00:03:51,528 --> 00:03:59,217
Some animals have developed evermore effective possibilities to make it through this race.

29
00:03:59,217 --> 00:04:07,081
Thus, this dragonfly occupies two habitats, - after her metamorphosis it leaves the water and conquers the sky.

30
00:04:11,505 --> 00:04:15,173
And also the other organisms don't miss out on any chance (of preying).

31
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,592
This is the underlying cause for nature's diversity.

32
00:04:22,527 --> 00:04:26,378
The creation of the richness of life proceeded over a long time.

33
00:04:26,842 --> 00:04:33,778
Out of relatively simple organisms, over millions of years evermore complex organisms developed.

34
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:42,144
All living species nowadays are a result of this evolution.

35
00:04:42,144 --> 00:04:48,314
Some had to change throughout evolution relatively little to adapt to ever-new conditions.

36
00:04:48,630 --> 00:04:50,909
Others were subdued to gigantic upheaval.

37
00:04:54,792 --> 00:04:57,289
So was man.

38
00:04:57,142 --> 00:05:05,405
The development from an ape-like species to man is for us probably the most amazing process in evolution.

39
00:05:12,725 --> 00:05:20,992
Significant restructuring of the hand and brain gave him the decisive ability to shape his own environment.

40
00:05:20,992 --> 00:05:26,081
The path was now free for the next stage - the modern human.

41
00:05:28,908 --> 00:05:37,615
And so our first direct ancestors, about 150.000 years ago, became a reality.

42
00:05:38,366 --> 00:05:46,346
As unlikely as it seems, evolution is based on random changes and relentless assortment.

43
00:05:49,181 --> 00:05:54,838
This rabbit species has found a way to cope with the change of the seasons.

44
00:05:54,838 --> 00:06:04,847
In winter its fur color changes, it becomes white. Rabbits without this feature were easy prey, like this partridge...

45
00:06:04,847 --> 00:06:09,216
...who because of its color which contrasts to the snow makes a distinctive target.

46
00:06:11,796 --> 00:06:16,331
Predators lurk everywhere and see their chance of survival.

47
00:06:26,104 --> 00:06:33,665
Like in this scene, the same thing happened to those rabbits who weren't able to adapt their fur color.

48
00:06:33,665 --> 00:06:36,099
They died out. Evolution ran them over.

49
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:46,146
Winter-white-furred animals had a significant life advantage and could prevail till today.

50
00:06:48,569 --> 00:06:55,102
On the entire earth, life had to meet this and other challenges.

51
00:06:57,286 --> 00:07:00,801
Each landscape entails its own conditions.

52
00:07:00,801 --> 00:07:07,117
As different as the land, as different are its inhabitants.

53
00:07:07,318 --> 00:07:17,787
Some animals have succeeded in adapting to changing climate conditions, like this fox, which adapted by changing its shape.

54
00:07:20,876 --> 00:07:24,481
Here with us, it shows in its familiar shape.

55
00:07:29,011 --> 00:07:34,392
In ice and snow, in the polar region, this fox species has developed...

56
00:07:33,981 --> 00:07:39,290
...completely different so, in the Sahara. The big ears serve for optimal heat exchange.

57
00:07:39,290 --> 00:07:48,596
In the cold instead, a small surface is of advantage. All these adaptations are ultimately determined through our hereditary information within the cells - the genes.

58
00:07:48,596 --> 00:07:56,738
In them lies encoded how the shape of the animals change "during" evolution. 

59
00:07:58,929 --> 00:08:04,528
In the example of the fly, researchers have tried to unravel the secret and see beyond evolution's game.

60
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:09,729
Hardly any other animal had subsequently been so intensively studied.

61
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,099
The fly developmental follows an exact plan.

62
00:08:16,099 --> 00:08:24,539
Genes are switched on and off. Each body segment is passed along exactly the commands which are crucial for its development.

63
00:08:27,066 --> 00:08:31,633
Researchers have identified the most significant genes for this process. (google: homeotic genes)

64
00:08:31,633 --> 00:08:40,048
The surprise: only a few key genes control the whole process...

65
00:08:40,488 --> 00:08:43,927
and this principle is found in all organisms in nature.

66
00:08:44,601 --> 00:08:52,053
In these zebra fish (Brachydanio rerio) for example, the development seems to progress completely different from (the dev. in) insects.

67
00:08:54,927 --> 00:09:00,219
But herein too lies a surprising finding. The same key genes like in flies (Drosophilidae)...

68
00:09:00,219 --> 00:09:04,622
..are responsible in fish (Craniata) for the formation of their outer shape (morphogenesis).

69
00:09:04,622 --> 00:09:09,533
A significant clue to a common origin of life on earth.

70
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:19,485
And also other animals have these comparable gene sequences - a universal tool kit of nature. 

71
00:09:19,485 --> 00:09:25,966
So it is possible to adapt to changing environmental conditions, from which completely different body shapes can develop.

72
00:09:29,769 --> 00:09:33,471
An example for this comes from Madagascar.

73
00:09:34,074 --> 00:09:39,344
In the genetic material of this Lemur, a baffling adaptation is reflected (/anchored).

74
00:09:39,344 --> 00:09:44,656
What looks like a malformation, unravels as an elaborate tool in foraging.

75
00:09:44,454 --> 00:09:53,000
The special finger assumes a similar functions as the woodpecker's beak and tongue.

76
00:09:53,000 --> 00:10:01,633
With this finger, fat worms are sensed and its special shape allows fetching them out of the tree trunk.

77
00:10:06,387 --> 00:10:10,651
A tidbit for the Lemur.

78
00:10:12,338 --> 00:10:17,856
This were just a few of the mosaic puzzles which support the theory of evolution.

79
00:10:18,126 --> 00:10:32,491
The basic idea is that, that the vast diversity of life on earth came about because animals had to adapt to constantly changing conditions and will have to do so in the future.

80
00:10:32,778 --> 00:10:42,211
The possibilities of variation lie within the hereditary molecule. - the hereditary molecule itself is not constant and this in turn is the opportunity(chance) for evolution.

81
00:10:42,425 --> 00:10:47,228
The hereditary molecule is changed for instance by radiation.

82
00:10:47,643 --> 00:10:58,808
The hereditary molecule gets damaged, repairs in a different way - and in the process mutations occur, which are passed along in subsequent cell divisions.

83
00:10:59,146 --> 00:11:05,408
These mutations can amount to all the advantage required to be successful in a certain environmental niche.

84
00:11:05,853 --> 00:11:12,215
Or, also this drives the evolution forward: Sex. Besides the fun associated with it,..

85
00:11:12,519 --> 00:11:20,503
..which gets us to perform this activity in the first place, ultimately different hereditary molecules, and thus different genes, merge.

86
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:32,563
And therefore new combinations come about which can mean new abilities for the resulting individual, letting it survive much better in a certain environment.

87
00:11:33,975 --> 00:11:36,497

88
00:11:33,018 --> 00:11:37,742
Sex therefore, the mingling of genes is one engine of evolution.

89
00:11:39,811 --> 00:11:52,948
The theory of evolution is profoundly established, and since Darwin - since 150 years ago, legions of scientists are working meticulously on testing or supporting it.

90
00:11:52,948 --> 00:12:05,760
And it is virtually unimaginable that in a modern society this established theory would have ever become hard-pressed, not indeed by objective scientific arguments but by political and religious movements (currents).

91
00:12:06,192 --> 00:12:11,702
Is this the end of science? A glance into the fog of creationism...

92
00:12:18,346 --> 00:12:26,747
Like this (scenes) it shall supposedly have happened on earth, when an ueber-entity, -a god-, created man and animal.

93
00:12:27,138 --> 00:12:31,153
At least such is the imagination of  creationists.

94
00:12:31,153 --> 00:12:36,972
Instead of a millions of years lasting developing process, man came about in just one single day.

95
00:12:45,467 --> 00:12:51,118
And also other life forms have been created at breathtaking pace.

96
00:12:51,118 --> 00:13:03,751
The diverse shape of insects for example, would therefore not have been a result of adaptation and selection, but rather like in a toolkit, a creator supposedly assembled the different components according to a fixed plan.

97
00:13:03,751 --> 00:13:06,797
An Intelligent Designer creates the world.

98
00:13:13,943 --> 00:13:21,735
This creationism finds ever more followers, especially here in the USA.

99
00:13:24,023 --> 00:13:28,231
The literal quotes from the bible are supposed to (/shall) replace the biology education.

100
00:13:28,231 --> 00:13:36,469
The creation-account shall, according to the faith of the creationists, represent a factually true portrayal of the formation of life and of the world itself.

101
00:13:37,617 --> 00:13:47,310
Half of the Americans are strongly convinced that the theory of evolution is nonsense and Darwin a charlatan.

102
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:52,737
And so everything happened, if one believes the creationists...

103
00:13:53,734 --> 00:13:59,525
Only 6000 years ago the earth came into being, as a ready, finished product.

104
00:13:59,525 --> 00:14:05,685
Our planet looked pretty much the same as it does now, oceans, and mountains already existed

105
00:14:05,685 --> 00:14:08,605
The geological processes shall have never occurred.

106
00:14:09,467 --> 00:14:14,183
The mountains towered themselves up within the shortest of time, in total contrast to the insight of geological science....

107
00:14:14,468 --> 00:14:22,421
the Alps didn't require millions of years of formation but merely a few hours.

108
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:28,696
In the world of creationists all animals were created at the same time...

109
00:14:28,696 --> 00:14:35,794
...though some animals died out. There was a time where Dinosaurs were living together with giraffes(Giraffidae) and antelopes(Bovidae)

110
00:14:36,113 --> 00:14:40,924
- This as well, against all of scientific knowledge.

111
00:14:42,259 --> 00:14:47,089
Even humans shall have lived concurrently with the primordial giants.

112
00:14:47,405 --> 00:14:54,592
The same motifs we know well from the Hollywood dream factory becomes an undisputable truth for creationists.

113
00:14:55,469 --> 00:15:06,319
But the idyll didn't last forever and the sinful earth inhabitants shall have had to be punished by a devastating catastrophe.

114
00:15:06,708 --> 00:15:12,281
According to the literal interpretation of the bible however, history succeeded in saving a couple of each animal (species).

115
00:15:12,281 --> 00:15:20,279
The Ark-Noah shall even have provided shelter for Dinosaurs which have been taken on board as eggs.

116
00:15:20,488 --> 00:15:26,557
Then came the Flood, relentlessly waging, and transforming (/changing) the surface of the earth forever.

117
00:15:26,557 --> 00:15:30,560
Only due to the protection of the Ark, life could persevere (/continue).

118
00:15:41,803 --> 00:15:49,313
Outside of the ship, everything was destroyed.

119
00:15:51,473 --> 00:16:00,432
Creationists, thus interpret fossils - bone-discoveries from primordial times-, differently: as testimony of this catastrophe.

120
00:16:01,531 --> 00:16:11,455
After the Flood the bones supposedly became petrified within 4000 years, by scientific concensus a process which takes at least 10.000 years, in most cases even way longer.

121
00:16:12,878 --> 00:16:19,408
Dinosaur bones, virtually a testimony for evolution, are transformed (/changed) into witnesses of the Flood.

122
00:16:19,408 --> 00:16:27,193
A hair-raising scenario which is ignoring all fundamental knowledge of geology and biology.

123
00:16:27,193 --> 00:16:32,707
What is left, is a science-adversarial belief with the intend to anchor itself in the people's minds.

124
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:43,121
With neat songs, brain washing is carried out at an early age.(songs) like: “I don't believe in evolution - I know that the creationism is true”.

125
00:16:48,302 --> 00:17:00,918
Manipulation instead of insight and empiricism - a state, we all thought to have left behind us long ago, but the pressure of creationists is not just increasing in the USA...

126
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:13,278
... but also in Europe. For instance, recently in Italy, and also in Germany, we encounter Creationists attempting to anchor their ideas in the scholary education system through books.

127
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:19,636
Some creationists are actually not talking about a god who created everything, but rather they talk about an Intelligent Designer.

128
00:17:19,636 --> 00:17:28,267
...this is however nothing but a mere strategical ploy in order to become established within the educational system of the United States.

129
00:17:28,267 --> 00:17:33,992
The theory of evolution is not doubted among scientists.

130
00:17:33,992 --> 00:17:45,472
Surely there a few missing spots which are yet to be filled, - what this research and the building blocks of the theory of evolution looks like, can be seen in the following scenes.

131
00:17:46,127 --> 00:17:51,455
The world 400 million years ago.

132
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:57,262
Here, a revolution happened with the formation (/development) of vertebrae.

133
00:17:57,005 --> 00:18:05,619
Not the flashy underwater predators are cause for the change but a inconspicuous life form with leg-like extremities.

134
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:10,500
The fish(ichthyes) conquer the land.

135
00:18:13,753 --> 00:18:19,564
A process which occurred relatively swift - it only took approx. 14 million years for the formation of amphibians....

136
00:18:20,723 --> 00:18:25,367
...from which in turn, later on reptiles developed.

137
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:32,372
Geologists are fervently searching for remnants which document such decisive moments (in history).

138
00:18:32,698 --> 00:18:38,508
A fish with feet would be (yet) another testament to the theory of evolution.

139
00:18:40,453 --> 00:18:43,678
And this search was successful.

140
00:18:43,678 --> 00:18:47,337
Fossil finds show that these intermediary steps did exists.

141
00:18:47,337 --> 00:18:53,325
In this animal one can clearly recognize the new digits which allowed for the (first) step on land.

142
00:19:01,646 --> 00:19:06,033
About the reason itself to leave water, one can only speculate.

143
00:19:06,362 --> 00:19:11,269
The opening up of new food sources are the most likely explanation.

144
00:19:13,465 --> 00:19:16,685
The development of the feet had far reaching consequences.

145
00:19:16,899 --> 00:19:22,001
All land living vertebra still carry this heritage in their physique till today.

146
00:19:22,001 --> 00:19:26,095
Fundamentally four extremities a part of their blueprint (Tetrapods).

147
00:19:26,223 --> 00:19:32,629
Also birds possess the same skeleton layout (/pattern). They have conquered the air as their habitat.

148
00:19:34,811 --> 00:19:42,351
Even in whales and dolphins the lower limbs are still conserved as tiny remnants (vestigials) within their body.

149
00:19:45,752 --> 00:19:49,904
The development of the sea mammals does however contain even further surprises.

150
00:19:50,193 --> 00:19:55,113
Killer whales (Orcinus orca) are a prime example for the functioning of evolution.

151
00:19:56,354 --> 00:19:59,768
The killer whales are said to be the kings of the oceans.

152
00:20:00,263 --> 00:20:04,400
A title which does not just pertain to their present day predatory behavior....

153
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,455
but also because their ancestors, many millions of years ago were wolf-like hunters.

154
00:20:11,705 --> 00:20:16,736
An increasingly scarce habitat forced the animals back into water. 

155
00:20:16,736 --> 00:20:22,223
Gradually they adapted to the life in the sea and developed their typical appearance.

156
00:20:22,223 --> 00:20:29,372
Today’s appearance of killer whales and dolphins hardly reveals (/lets one anticipate) the moving past of those animals.

157
00:20:29,372 --> 00:20:33,100
At first glance their appearance equals perfectly those of fish...

158
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:41,694
...such as sharks. But there are many differences, in contrast to sharks these fish swim differently, - they wiggle through the water.

159
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:52,551
If one however examines the swimming movements of dolphins one will find remarkable parallels to those (motions) of land living animals, like the otter.

160
00:20:54,624 --> 00:20:58,280
The swimming technique equals those of whales and dolphins.

161
00:20:58,517 --> 00:21:06,606
Instead of wiggling through the water the forward movement is caused by lowering and raising of the entire body and by curving of the whole spine.

162
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:11,815
A method which has also proven of value for the movement on land.

163
00:21:11,815 --> 00:21:17,024
This technique of the sea mammals has been upheld during their step back into water.

164
00:21:21,525 --> 00:21:31,572
As such the swimming style of dolphins and killer whales is just one example of many, from which one can trace back the trail of evolution, even till today.

165
00:21:33,023 --> 00:21:38,640
But there is an even more distinctive connection which ties together all living animals today.

166
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:48,619
The most distinct animals, the vast domain of plants and even bacteria display through one feature their common origin: their DNA.

167
00:21:48,944 --> 00:21:58,518
- the hereditary molecule. Indifferent to the life forms in which the DNA is contained, it always exists out of the same four chemical building blocks.

168
00:21:58,518 --> 00:22:05,776
Solely the sequence (/assembly) of those building blocks accounts for the differences in the life forms.

169
00:22:05,776 --> 00:22:11,420
Even small changes in the genetic code can lead to enormous changes of the physique.

170
00:22:11,420 --> 00:22:14,493
This was shown experimentally in crustaceans.

171
00:22:20,895 --> 00:22:26,433
Modern genetics thus delivers the most important testimony for the theory of evolution.

172
00:22:26,433 --> 00:22:34,951
It shows that throughout all life on earth, like a red thread, "stretches" only one single molecule: DNA

173
00:22:34,951 --> 00:22:43,151
Out of the varied assembly of those building blocks the diversity of life formed.

174
00:22:47,747 --> 00:22:55,031
According to the given environmental circumstances, life forms developed which could survive within the niches of our earth.

175
00:22:55,745 --> 00:23:01,418
..and man too is ultimately a product of this evolution.

176
00:23:01,687 --> 00:23:04,173
Baby: Baeeeh!

177
00:23:04,853 --> 00:23:09,123
The way we picture the world is profoundly affected by the natural sciences...

178
00:23:09,123 --> 00:23:19,353
...and ultimately our existence in our highly organized societies, on an overpopulated earth - depends on the very progress of those natural sciences.

179
00:23:19,353 --> 00:23:32,613
If we fall back into mystical world views of past centuries then not only will our mental world impoverish but also our (/this) existence on earth will be threatened.

180
00:23:32,641 --> 00:23:39,658
For this, we have a classical example, from the thirties and forties of the ex-Soviet Union, - during the Stalin era.

181
00:23:39,885 --> 00:23:48,317
At that time, one man succeeded to completely re-function an entire scientific discipline, his name: Trofim Lysenko. (A man responsible for the demise of millions and suffering continuing to today!)

182
00:23:48,630 --> 00:23:59,264
He negated at that time the emerging field of genetics, by following a motto on the lines of: place one sack of grain into the cold and yet all grains are chill resistant.

183
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:08,118
He let his scientific opponents be politically persecuted, or even liquidated and overturned a whole nation into misery.

184
00:24:12,724 --> 00:24:20,166
The institutes for genetics in the Soviet Union have been taken over in the thirties by Trofim Lysenko.

185
00:24:20,166 --> 00:24:28,911
He promised, as loyal party member, to breed novel, more productive sorts and in the process solve the nutritional problem in the Soviet Union

186
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:37,578
He claimed that changes in the form of environmental factors would be passed on congentially to the whole plant.

187
00:24:37,578 --> 00:24:43,518
For plant breeding this meant the exposition of the crop to very cold temperatures.

188
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:50,009
If it would survive this shock therapy, also all its offspring would be hardened against chill.

189
00:24:51,988 --> 00:25:01,265
Lysenko denied the existence of genes and chromosomes even though the international research efforts at that time clearly demonstrated this in evermore experiments.

190
00:25:06,223 --> 00:25:13,122
The imagination of such easily imprintable new characteristics was in excellent accord (/matched) with the ideology of communism...

191
00:25:13,122 --> 00:25:18,510
...for it was dreaming about the new human, which should be re-educated.

192
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:27,099
According to Lysenko the coming generations would now have internalized the ideals of communism and would pass them along to their progeny.

193
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:34,450
And Lysenko operated in accord with this scheme.

194
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:37,990
Stalin supported the fanatic party comrade, Lysenko.

195
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:44,289
Even though his scientific qualifications were doubtful, his propaganda was however efficient.

196
00:25:44,289 --> 00:25:56,300
With promises which were in exact alignment with the party, and also meant a revolutionary abandonment of the capitalistic mindset of the west, he secured himself Stalin’s back.

197
00:25:59,813 --> 00:26:05,386
Thus his ill-teachings became an integral part of all scholarly education and curricula.

198
00:26:05,863 --> 00:26:14,629
Additionally Lysenko promised the paradise. All nutritional problems shall have been eliminated at once so long one followed his visions

199
00:26:18,461 --> 00:26:22,599
Lysenko’s scientific opponents were denounced as public enemies. 

200
00:26:22,599 --> 00:26:32,549
The scientific elite of Russian gene research, which  at that time was leading worldwide, vanished into exile or was simply liquidated.

201
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:42,961
Even though Lysenko's ideas stood in stark contrast to all of secured scientific knowledge at that time, over the years the entirety of Soviet plant breeding was laid out that way.

202
00:26:43,254 --> 00:26:50,556
The crops treated according to his methods, were propagated as the salvation out of starvation.

203
00:26:50,556 --> 00:26:59,258
There was talk about new sorts, the doubling of the wool of sheep, and a tenfold increase of milk productivity in cows.

204
00:26:59,513 --> 00:27:08,314
Plant breeding was carried out by obscure methods, the failures obfuscated, results faked and success stories made up.

205
00:27:08,314 --> 00:27:14,118
As such for instance, chill-treated citrus fruits supposedly have been able to sprout in Siberia.

206
00:27:14,118 --> 00:27:18,582
The reality looked different than the peachy promises.

207
00:27:18,582 --> 00:27:22,816
The loss of culture plants were enormous, entire annual harvests were dropping out.

208
00:27:22,816 --> 00:27:27,064
Bitter starvation was breaking out in the population.

209
00:27:31,077 --> 00:27:36,938
Those failures didn't play any role however and were glossed over.

210
00:27:36,938 --> 00:27:40,720
For 16 years Lysenko could keep his leading position.

211
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:47,501
A sad example of how an desperate ideological pseudo-doctrine, can make science into a farce.

212
00:27:49,499 --> 00:27:59,619
Even to this day, Russian science is suffering from this literal exsanguination: it doesn't play any significant role in genetics anymore.

213
00:28:00,048 --> 00:28:09,458
This is a traumatic example of the aftermath that entails when political goals try to influence scientific results.

214
00:28:09,458 --> 00:28:21,423
If the creationists in the USA are making further grounds then the chance increases, that entire generations of pupils loose touch with modern natural sciences..

215
00:28:21,423 --> 00:28:28,412
...or might even demonize them, and above all no longer collaborates in the expansion of human knowledge.

216
00:28:28,412 --> 00:28:40,075
In other fields as well,  often observable is how politics influence science, for instance in the head-panels for stem cell research or energy strategies.

217
00:28:40,304 --> 00:28:49,774
It begs to hope that the freedom of natural sciences is upheld and we don't fall back into the darkness of arbitrarily established world views...

218
00:28:49,774 --> 00:28:55,024
...this was all for today, ...till next time, then...good evening!
